/*
 A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
 Package A:
 Package B:
 Package C:
 For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute.
 For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute.
 For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
 Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. It should then display the total amount due.
 Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C.
